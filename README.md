# Text - Based Adventure Game in C++
This repository contains the source code for a short text-based adventure game written using Object - Oriented Programming in C++

This was made as a final project for the C++ course PHYS30672 at the University of Manchester.


# Building the Code

The project can be compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
(https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). 
Running the Game.sln file should compile all the relevant .h and .cpp files, or they can be set up manually.

To compile on macOS, install Xcode from the App Store. Each chapter has
a corresponding .vcxproj file. (Note: This is currently untested)
